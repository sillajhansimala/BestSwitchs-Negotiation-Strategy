**Course:** EMGT 5320 / SYSE 5105  
**Role:** Seller ‚Äì JhansiMala Silla  
**Counterpart (Buyer):** Ravi Teja Reddy Kollu  
**Scenario:** Negotiating the sale of 116,000 electronic switches to Bell Telephone Company.

## üìù Overview

This document represents a classroom negotiation simulation where I played the role of a **Project Manager** at BestSwitchs, Inc. My goal was to negotiate favorable terms for the sale of electronic switches, considering manufacturing cost, delivery time, liability, warranty periods, and risk-related insurance.

Key terms of the final agreement:
- **Selling Price per Unit:** $3.75  
- **Delivery Time:** 21 days  
- **Warranty Period:** 7 months  
- **Waiver of Consequential Damages:** No  
- **Limitation of Liability:** Yes  
- **Total Sale Value:** $435,000 (116,000 units)

## üí∏ Financial Summary

### Costs:
- **Manufacturing Cost:** $3.15 per switch  
- **Risk Insurance (No Waiver of Consequential Damages):** $0.10 per switch  
- **Warranty Extension Insurance (1 extra month):** $0.10 per switch  
- **Total Cost per Unit:** $3.35  

### Profit Analysis:
- **Profit per Switch:** $3.75 - $3.35 = $0.40  
- **Original Profit Calculation (based on cost):**  
  `(0.40 / 3.35) √ó 100 ‚âà 11.94%`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Correction Note (Post-Grading)

After feedback from the professor, I learned that **profit percentage should be calculated based on revenue**, not cost. The correct formula is:

This adjustment clarified how **different profit metrics** can lead to **different strategic interpretations**, especially when pitching to stakeholders or evaluating performance. Profit based on cost is useful internally for evaluating margins, while profit based on revenue is often preferred for external reporting and negotiation assessments.

By applying the corrected method:
- **Corrected Profit Percentage:** ‚âà **13.33%**

This not only improved the grade potential but also highlighted the importance of financial literacy in negotiations.

## üß† Key Takeaways

- Always clarify which **profit metric** is expected (cost-based vs. revenue-based).
- Consider both **operational risks** and **contractual terms** when determining pricing.
- Feedback is a valuable part of the learning process ‚Äì and this example helped me refine my understanding of business metrics.
